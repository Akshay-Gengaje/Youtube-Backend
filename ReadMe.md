- **User Interaction**: Handle user interactions such as likes, comments, and subscriptions.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement a robust search functionality to enable users to discover content easily.
- **Data Storage**: Utilize MongoDB to store and retrieve video data, user information, and related metadata.
- **Middleware**: Implement middleware for error handling, request logging, and other necessary functionalities.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind to handle a growing number of users and videos.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for efficient data storage.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **RESTful APIs**: Follow RESTful principles for a clean and scalable API design.
